| **5.1** | **Cohesion, Coupling, and Separation of Concerns** | Learn the core design vocabulary of cohesion, coupling, and SoC. See how to keep classes focused, reduce dependencies, and separate logic from UI. Explore small refactors that improve design quality and readability.          | https://youtu.be/v3bt50ryv0E        | 00:26:13       |
| **5.1b** | **Refactor** | Refactoring a giant constructor doesn’t have to be scary. In this video, I take a messy, monolithic Java constructor and break it down into smaller, cleaner files that span across multiple layers. The goal isn’t to create a perfect app (there are still other code smells left behind), but to show the practical process of turning working—but bad—code into working and maintainable code. This video is a hands-on demonstration, not a replacement for in-class learning. If you’ve ever wondered how to start untangling legacy code without breaking it, this walkthrough will give you a clear, step-by-step example.         |https://youtu.be/6LUBIajDrTU| 00:23:39       |
| **5.2** | **DRY, KISS, and PoLA**                            | Explore pragmatic design principles: Don’t Repeat Yourself, Keep It Simple, and the Principle of Least Astonishment. See code examples that violate all three, then walk through refactors that simplify and clarify behavior.   |https://youtu.be/pBbwpfSFZes| 00:21:43       |
| **5.3** | **SOLID (Part 1: SRP, OCP, LSP)**                  | Begin learning the SOLID principles with Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and Liskov Substitution. See real examples of violations, explore strategies like the strategy pattern, and test your understanding with scenarios. | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **5.4** | **SOLID (Part 2: ISP, DIP)**                       | Continue with Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion. Learn how to avoid “fat” interfaces, apply dependency injection, and refactor code step by step to follow SOLID.                                                   | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **5.5** | **Refactoring Code: Common Smells & Fixes**        | Discover common code smells such as long methods, shotgun surgery, and god classes. Learn how to fix them with SOLID principles and see a refactoring demo that shows cleaner, testable design without changing behavior.        | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
