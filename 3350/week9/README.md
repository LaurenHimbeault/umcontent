| **9.1**| **What Is Legacy Code? (And Why It’s Normal)**  | Demystify legacy code by defining it as “code without tests” and recognizing its presence in real systems like banking and government apps. Learn why legacy ≠ bad, and how to approach it with the right mindset. | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **9.2**| **Building & Tracing Through Legacy Systems**   | Learn how to safely explore fragile systems by first compiling, then tracing through runtime with breakpoints, logs, and scratchpad diagrams. Practice connecting random methods to real features.                 | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **9.3**| **Reconstructing Architecture from Code**       | Rebuild missing architecture diagrams by starting at entry points, sketching layers, and validating with code tracing. See common “wild architectures” like accidental MVC or monolithic god classes.              | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **9.4**| **Adding New Features to Legacy Systems Safely**| Explore strategies for extending legacy codebases without breaking them. Use feature flags, adapters, and sprouting techniques to add features while minimizing risk and leaving breadcrumbs for maintainers.      | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
