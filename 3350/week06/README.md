| **6.1** | **Problems with Inheritance**                | Explore why inheritance often leads to fragile designs. See real-world pitfalls like contract violations, unused methods, and tight coupling. Learn when inheritance makes sense and when composition is better. |https://youtu.be/RNrnJYwRUFY| 00:12:28       |
| **6.2** | **Composition & Interface-Based Design**     | Learn how “has-a” and “uses-a” designs improve flexibility. See how small interfaces and composition (e.g., strategy pattern) make code easier to extend, test, and refactor compared to rigid hierarchies.      |https://youtu.be/-4ALxD1YcD0| 00:10:26       |
| **6.3** | **Dependency Injection: What, Why, and How** | Understand how constructor-based injection decouples classes and improves testability. Refactor examples to remove `new` inside classes, inject dependencies, and design cleaner, more adaptable systems.        |https://youtu.be/5bmVFlrsbfE| 00:09:45       |
| **6.4** | **Cross-Cutting Concerns & Error-Handling**  | Discover how to handle logging, validation, and errors without cluttering business logic. Learn layered exception handling (DB → business → UI), fail-fast strategies, and ways to keep systems resilient.       |https://youtu.be/w4cUV2MPyT4| 00:27:03       |
