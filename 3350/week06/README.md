| **6.1**| **Problems with Inheritance**               | Explore why inheritance often leads to fragile designs. See real-world pitfalls like contract violations, unused methods, and tight coupling. Learn when inheritance makes sense and when composition is better. | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **6.2**| **Composition & Interface-Based Design**    | Learn how “has-a” and “uses-a” designs improve flexibility. See how small interfaces and composition (e.g., strategy pattern) make code easier to extend, test, and refactor compared to rigid hierarchies.      | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **6.3**| **Dependency Injection: What, Why, and How**| Understand how constructor-based injection decouples classes and improves testability. Refactor examples to remove `new` inside classes, inject dependencies, and design cleaner, more adaptable systems.        | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **6.4**| **Cross-Cutting Concerns & Error-Handling** | Discover how to handle logging, validation, and errors without cluttering business logic. Learn layered exception handling (DB → business → UI), fail-fast strategies, and ways to keep systems resilient.       | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
