| **8.1**| **Unit vs. Integration vs. End-to-End Tests**| Revisit the testing pyramid to see how unit, integration, and system tests fit together. Learn the tradeoffs of each level and visualize where to focus effort for speed, coverage, and reliability.          | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **8.2**| **Writing Integration & Acceptance Tests**   | Learn how to write tests that span multiple modules or validate user-level requirements. See examples of DB integration tests, acceptance tests for user stories, and best practices for organizing suites.   | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **8.3**| **Mocks and Fakes in Complex Test Suites**   | Deepen your use of test doubles in larger systems. Explore how to fake external APIs, use mocks for edge cases, and decide when to replace real services with controlled substitutes for faster, safer tests. | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **8.4**| **Flaky & Non-Deterministic Test Strategies**| Identify and fix tests that fail inconsistently due to timing, randomness, or concurrency. Learn stabilization strategies like mocking time, seeding randomness, and detecting isolation issues in CI.        | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
