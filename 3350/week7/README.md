| **7.1**| **What Are Design Patterns & When to Use Them**       | Learn what patterns are (and aren’t), from GoF foundations to modern use cases. Explore creational, structural, and behavioral categories, see when patterns improve clarity and extensibility, and learn to avoid “pattern soup.” | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **7.2**| **Factory, Singleton, Adapter Patterns**              | Dive into three essential patterns: Factory for object creation, Singleton for controlled instancing, and Adapter for bridging incompatible interfaces. Includes examples, diagrams, and practical comparisons.                    | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **7.3**| **Observer & Chain of Responsibility Patterns**       | Explore two powerful behavioral patterns: Observer for event-driven notifications and Chain of Responsibility for flexible request pipelines. Learn real-world uses in GUIs, logging, and middleware systems.                      | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
| **7.4**| **Architectural Design Patterns (MVC, Layered, etc.)**| Move from micro-patterns to system-level architecture. Understand MVC and layered design, see how they enforce separation of concerns, and compare with alternatives like hexagonal or microservices for scalability.              | TBA        | 00:00:00       |
