| 1    | Software Development Models & Agile Foundations     | This video introduces key software development models, focusing on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) stages and comparing agile with heavyweight approaches. Students explore the Agile Manifesto, iterative development, and the path from vision to user stories. The week emphasizes understanding how SDLC stages integrate into different processes and the priorities of agile development. By framing development as an iterative, collaborative process, students begin preparing for the term-long team project. | [week1-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week01)  | 
| 2    | From Vision to Architecture & Release Planning      | This week bridges the gap between a product vision and its technical execution. Students learn to write high-quality user stories, create architecture diagrams that define system boundaries, and produce release plans that fit agile workflows. Through examples and a sample project walkthrough, they see how planning artifacts guide incremental development and align teams.                                                                                                                                               | [week2-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week02)  | 
| 3    | Version Control Strategies & Testing Fundamentals   | Students are introduced to Git workflows for collaborative software development, including branching, merge requests, and conflict resolution. Testing foundations are established through the testing pyramid and test-driven development (TDD). The week connects version control practices with early testing to ensure maintainable, high-quality code from the start of the project.                                                                                                                                          |[week3-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week03)  | 
| 4    | Testing Edge Cases & Managing Technical Debt        | This week deepens testing skills with exceptional paths, edge cases, and test doubles. Students explore technical debtâ€”its causes, detection, and avoidance strategiesâ€”alongside agile execution realities such as team roles and velocity tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |[week4-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week04)  | 
| 5    | Clean Code Principles & Continuous Refactoring      | Focusing on design quality, students measure cohesion and coupling, apply DRY, KISS, and SOLID principles, and recognize code smells. Refactoring techniques are practiced to maintain and improve code quality, with an emphasis on sustainable team development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [week5-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week05)  | 
| 6    | Composition, Dependency Injection & Error Isolation | Students learn why composition often outperforms inheritance, how dependency injection reduces coupling, and how to implement error-handling strategies without unnecessary dependencies. This week emphasizes designing flexible, maintainable systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [week6-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week06)  | 
| 7    | Applying Design Patterns & Architectures            | Students explore creational, structural, and behavioral design patternsâ€”Factory, Adapter, Observer, and moreâ€”and compare architectural styles such as MVC and layered architectures. They justify pattern selection in refactoring scenarios and integrate patterns into team projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [week7-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week07)  | 
| 8    | Integration & Acceptance Testing Strategies         | Building on earlier testing topics, students implement integration and acceptance tests, handle complex test doubles in large systems, and address flaky or non-deterministic tests. The focus is on ensuring stability and reliability in evolving projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [week8-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week08)  | 
| 9    | Understanding & Improving Legacy Systems            | This week covers working with undocumented, fragile, or legacy systems. Students learn techniques for reconstructing architecture, safely adding features, and minimizing regressions while improving maintainability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [week9-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week09)  | 
| 10   | Measuring Success & Professional Growth             | Students learn to measure project and team performance using metrics such as burndown and velocity charts. They explore different software engineering roles and reflect on their growth as engineers over the term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [week10-material](https://github.com/LaurenHimbeault/umcontent/tree/main/3350/week10)  |
